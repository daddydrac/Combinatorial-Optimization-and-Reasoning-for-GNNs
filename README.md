# Combinatorial Optimization and Reasoning or GNNs
Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for combinatorial optimization (CO) offers specific advantages for problems where traditional methods struggle due to complexity, data dependency, or the need for real-time solutions.

<strong>Problem:</strong> Managing mega-constellations (e.g., Starlink, OneWeb) involves optimizing communication paths, maintaining orbits, and minimizing fuel usage for adjustments. Why GNNs? Graph Representation: Satellites form a communication network, where nodes represent satellites and edges represent communication links. GNN Role: Optimize routing paths for satellite-to-satellite communication to minimize latency. Predict failures or disruptions in the network by aggregating historical telemetry and sensor data. 

<strong>Benefit over Baseline:</strong> Traditional heuristics may struggle to handle the dynamic and large-scale nature of constellations, while GNNs can generalize and adapt to evolving network conditions.
